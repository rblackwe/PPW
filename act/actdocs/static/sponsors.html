<h1>Become a sponsor</h1>
<h2>Why Sponsor PPW?</h2>

<ol>
    <li><em>Sponsorship puts you on display.</em> It demonstrates your leadership to the 
    very professionals who are shaping the future of technology.
    <li><em>Sponsorship helps you meet talented future employees.</em>The PPW draws 
    a diverse selection of particularly talented programmers from around the 
    world and concentrates them at one event. Show these programmers that 
    you are an employer that supports what they value.
    <li><em>Sponsorship aids a great cause.</em> It supports the programming community 
    and the community's traditions of rich technical talks, sharing, and fellowship.
</ol>

<h2>How to sponsor</h2>

<p>Sponsoring is easy: Just email <a href="mailto:sponsors@pghpw.org">sponsors@pghpw.org</a> and say, "I'm interested 
in sponsorship."  We'll work something out. In general, though, here's what 
we are looking for.</p>

<p>Our budget estimate for PPW 2013 is $20,000, which will cover conference 
facilities, food service, social gatherings, limited speaker expenses, printing 
costs, and the tutorials. We are seeking a few sponsors to underwrite the 
bulk of these expenses. Ideally, we would have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>one <em>event sponsor</em> to underwrite about one-half of the conference expenses, in consideration for which the sponsor will be prominently recognized on the conference web site and in all official conference materials (minimum contribution: $10,000);</li>
    <li>two to four <em>contributing sponsors</em> to underwrite the balance of the major 
    conference expenses, in consideration for which the sponsors will be acknowledged on the conference web site and in all official conference materials (minimum contribution: $2,500); and</li>
    <li>two to four <em>community sponsors</em> to provide limited sponsorship for events 
    such as after-event social gatherings and programming "hackathons." (minimum contribution: $500)</li>
</ul>
