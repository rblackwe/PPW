        <ol>
            <li><em>Sponsorship puts you on display.</em> It demonstrates your leadership to the 
            very professionals who are shaping the future of technology.
            <li><em>Sponsorship helps you meet talented future employees.</em>The PPW draws 
            a diverse selection of particularly talented programmers from around the 
            world and concentrates them at one event. Show these programmers that 
            you are an employer that supports what they value.
            <li><em>Sponsorship aids a great cause.</em> It supports the programming community 
            and the community's traditions of rich technical talks, sharing, and fellowship.

        <h3>How to sponsor</h3>

        <p>The best way to be a sponsor is through <a href="http://donate.perlfoundation.org">The Perl Foundation.</a>   By becoming a TPF sponsor, you'll automatically become a sponsor of PPW as well as every other conference run through TPF for one year.    There are several levels of sponsorship available through TPF.   You can read about them in their <a href="http://donate.perlfoundation.org/prospectus.html">their sponsorship prospectus.</a>

        <p>Would you rather only sponsor PPW?   That's easy also: Just email <a
            href="mailto:sponsors@pghpw.org">sponsors@pghpw.org</a> and say, "I'm
        interested in sponsorship."  We'll work something out. In general, though,
        here's what we are looking for.</p>

        <p>Our budget estimate for PPW [% site.event_year %] is $20,000, which will
        cover conference facilities, food service, social gatherings, limited speaker
        expenses, printing costs, and the tutorials. We are seeking a few sponsors to
        underwrite the bulk of these expenses. Ideally, we would have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>one <em>event sponsor</em> to underwrite about one-half of the conference expenses, in consideration for which the sponsor will be prominently recognized on the conference web site and in all official conference materials (minimum contribution: $10,000);</li>
            <li>two to four <em>contributing sponsors</em> to underwrite the balance of the major 
            conference expenses, in consideration for which the sponsors will be acknowledged on the conference web site and in all official conference materials (minimum contribution: $2,500); and</li>
            <li>two to four <em>community sponsors</em> to provide limited sponsorship for events 
            such as after-event social gatherings and programming "hackathons." (minimum contribution: $500)</li>
        </ul>
