<h2>Intro to Moose</h2>

<p>There is an additional registration fee to take this all-day class. Please be sure
to select the "[% global.config.product_moose_name_en %]" option when registering. Seating in this
course is limited.</p>

<h2>About the course.</h2>

<p>Join us for an interactive hands-on course all about Moose. Moose is an OO
system for Perl 5 that provides a simple declarative layer of "sugar" on top of
a powerful, extensible meta-model.</p>

<p> With Moose, simple classes can be created without writing any subroutines,
and complex classes can be simplified. Moose's features include a powerful
attribute declaration system, type constraints and coercions, method modifiers
("before", "after", and "around"), a role system (like mixins on steroids), and
more. Moose also has a vibrant ecosystem of extensions as seen in the variety
of MooseX:: modules on CPAN.</p>

<p>This course will cover Moose's core features and explore some of the more
powerful MooseX:: modules available on CPAN.</p>

<p>Students are expected to bring a laptop, as you will be writing code during
the class. You will also be provided with a tarball a week or so before the
class is scheduled, which will contain a directory tree skeleton and test
files.</p>

<p>Here's some feedback from past students:</p>

<ul>
    <li>"I thought Dave's class was outstanding. Well prepared and highly valuable content." - Chris Fedde
    <li>"It damn sure was a good use! It would've been a huge mistake not taking your class; Moose is a magnificent beast and I couldn't have picked a better primer." - Brian Fraser
    <li>"The class was great. There was a nice balance of material presented to hands-on experimentation, and alternating between lecture and exercises helped nail down concepts." - Philip Monsen
</ul>
