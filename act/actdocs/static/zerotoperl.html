<p>The Pittsburgh Perl Workshop and Infinity Interactive are proud to announce "[% site.ztp_name %]," a
special course for programmers new to the Perl programming language, to be
taught by John "genehack" Anderson on Friday, November 7th, 2014.</p>

<p>If you have purchased a pass to PPW, there is no additional fee for taking
From Zero to Perl.   However, seating is limited.    So, we do ask that you 
<a href="[% make_uri('purchase') %]">reserve your seat</a> ahead of time.   If you
have not purchased a weekend pass, then there will be a

<div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12">
<p>The "Zero To Perl" course is designed to introduce programmers of any experience level to Perl 5 programming.  People with zero programming experience are also welcome to attend, but should expect a rapid pace due to the one-day nature of the course.  This one-day course will give you the basic skills you'll need to program in Perl for a variety of tasks, including Web development, text processing, bioinformatics, database manipulation, systems administration, devops, and more.</p>

<p>The course will cover basic Perl syntax, including variables and data structures, flow control, functions, reading and writing files, and regular expressions.  Instruction will be interspersed with hands-on sessions where you'll put into practice the concepts that you have just learned. Instructors will be available to give each student direct assistance as needed.</p>

<p>After completing this course, you'll be ready to start writing your own Perl programs and you'll be perfectly positioned to enjoy the rest of PPW, even if this is your first exposure to Perl.</p>

<p>John SJ Anderson has been using Perl for over fifteen years, since teaching it to himself as part of a desperate plan to finish his graduate work. He's been teaching computing concepts and introductory Perl and BioPerl to bioinformatics students at The Johns Hopkins University for the last ten years. In his free time, John contributes to several Open Source projects, moderates the perl-beginners mailing list, and organizes the Salem Oregon Dynamic Languages Users Group.</p>
