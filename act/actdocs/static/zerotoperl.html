<h2>A one-day introductory Perl course</h2>

<p>The Pittsburgh Perl Workshop and Infinity Interactive are proud to announce "[% site.ztp_name %]," a
special course for programmers new to the Perl programming language, to be
taught by John "genehack" Anderson on Friday, October 4th, 2013.</p>

<p>There is an additional <a href="[% make_uri('costs.html') %]">registration fee</a> to take this course. Please be sure
to select the "[% site.ztp_name %]" option when registering. Seating in this
course is limited.</p>

<h2>About the Course:</h2>

<p>The "Zero To Perl" course is designed to introduce programmers of any experience level to Perl 5 programming. (Non-programmers are welcomed as well!) This one-day course will give you the basic skills you'll need to program in Perl for a variety of tasks, including Web development, text processing, bioinformatics, database manipulation, systems administration, devops, and more.</p>

<p>The course will cover basic Perl syntax, including variables and data structures, flow control, functions, reading and writing files, and regular expressions.  Instruction will be interspersed with hands-on sessions where you'll put into practice the concepts that you have just learned. Instructors will be available to give each student direct assistance as needed.</p>

<p>After completing this course, you'll be ready to start writing your own Perl programs and you'll be perfectly positioned to enjoy the rest of PPW, even if this is your first exposure to Perl.</p>

<p>John SJ Anderson has been using Perl for over fifteen years, since teaching it to himself as part of a desperate plan to finish his graduate work. He's been teaching computing concepts and introductory Perl and BioPerl to bioinformatics students at The Johns Hopkins University for the last ten years. In his free time, John contributes to several Open Source projects, moderates the perl-beginners mailing list, and organizes the Salem Oregon Dynamic Languages Users Group.</p>

<h2>Course Preparations:</h2>

<p>Students should bring a laptop, ideally with Perl and a programmer's text editor (such as Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, Notepad 2, etc.) already installed. Be prepared for an intense day of hands on learning. Code samples and course materials will be provided on site</p>
