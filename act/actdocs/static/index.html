<h2>About PPW</h2>
<p>
    Originally inspired by similar workshops in Europe, The [% site.event_name %]
    was established in 2006 as a low-cost technical conference for users of the
    Perl Programming Language.  The conference emphasizes real code and immediate,
    pratical solutions to common issues.
</p>
<p>
    Now in its fifth year, PPW has the distinction of being the oldest and
    longest running event of its type in the country.   Key members of the Perl
    Community travel from all across the country each year to participate in
    this event.
</p>
<p>
    For the first time ever, PPW 2013 will be held at the Pittsburgh Technical
    Institue in Oakdale, PA.   The workshop will be held October 4th through
    6th, 2013.
