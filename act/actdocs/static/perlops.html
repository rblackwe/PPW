<h2>Perl Ops</h2>

<p>The Perl Ops track contains topics relevant to System Administrators. Perl
has been used for systems administration since the 1980s, bringing the light of
automation to the sometimes-dark corners of computing infrastructure
environments.  Perl is the language of choice for many systems administration
tasks. And, with all the new challenges of running modern software services,
itâ€™s time to revisit how Perl makes Ops better.</p>

<p>Examples of Perl Ops topics might include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automated OS Deployment/Provisioning
<li>Automated Application Deployment
<li>Reproducibility of systems/services
<li>Configuration Management, including any of: staged release, version
control, bug tracking &amp; unit testing of configurations
<li>Scalability, High Availability and recovery/coping with failure
<li>Event Monitoring
<li>Usage Monitoring
<li>Log processing/analysis
<li>Correctness checking/Service validation
<li>Security from the beginning, Authentication/Authorization
<li>Programming to the specific OS
<li>Virtualization and/or Issues in Cloud Environments
<li>Backup and Disaster Recovery
<li>Basics of network service/server security from a systems or apps
perspective
</ul>

<p>Perl Ops talks seek to provide a mixture of 'Why?' talks that
promote/provide reasons why the recommendations are useful (and in what
circumstances they are/aren't applicable) and 'What/How?' talks that
show participants things that might be new to them.

<p>Currently a System Administrator for Google, Tom Limoncelli has been a
systems administrator and network engineer since 1987.   He is the author of
<i>Time Management for System Administrators</i>, and co-author of <i>The
    Practice of System and Network Administration</i>.   He has also published
papers at conferences such as the Usenix LISA conference on a wide variety of
topics including innovative firewall techniques, coordinating massive network
changes, models for improving customer support, and the security issues related
to firing your system administrator.   He often blogs on <a

<p clear="all">This year, Tom will be providing one of our keynote talks:</p>

<p><b>What Perl sysadmins wish Perl developers knew, and vice-versa ($a,$b) = ($b,$a)</b></p>

<p>
Sysadmin teams and a software development teams have been known to
work closely together, not at all, or somewhere in between.  What
happens when the barrier between such groups disappears and the two
teams become one?  The recent trend has been to incorporate "shared
responsibility" for operational matters such as deployment,
scalability and performance.  As a result projects are more successful
in ways one wouldn't have expected.
