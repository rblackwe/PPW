            <p>There will be a major sporting event going on in Pittsburgh during the
            same weekend as PPW.  Please reserve your rooms early, as it may not be
            possible for us to obtain more rooms once we get closer to the date of
            the event.  We have been able to reserve 25 rooms at the Quality Inn.
            Our exclusive hold on these rooms ends one month prior to PPW.<p>

            you reserve your room at least one month prior to your arrival and is only
