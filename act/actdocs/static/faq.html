<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>Who is this conference for?</h2> 

<p> Everybody! </p> 

<p>Talks range from beginner to advanced, ensuring that there's something in
there for everybody.   Regardless if you are a programmer that has little or no
Perl experience, or have already been using Perl for quite some time, there
will be something for you.</p>

<!--
<p>In [% site.event_year %], we bring back our well praised "<b>[% site.ztp_name %]
</b>" track.   This one-day special track, intended to complement our
introductory talks, will help bring you up to speed with Perl quickly.</p>
-->

<h2>What are "add-on classes?"</h2>

<p>Add-on classes are special full-day classes that take place the day before
the conference.   Typically, we hold a class called "From Zero to Perl",
intended for people that have some programming experience but may not know that
much about programming in Perl.    We also often hold other classes that may be
interesting to the community.</p>

<p>No add-on classes have been announced for this year.   You may want to join
our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ppw-announce">ppw-announce
list</a> so we can let you know once the details are ready.</p>

<h2>Is there an additional price for the add-on classes?</h2>

<p>Yes, due to the additional costs associated with these courses, there is an
additional fee.  Limited seating is available on a first-come first-serve
basis. </p>

<h2>If I attend the add-on classes, can I also go to other talks?</h2>

<p>Yes.  We will be holding the add-on classes on the day before PPW.   This
means that if you attend an add-on class, you will still be able to attend PPW
in its entirety.</p>

<!--
<h2>What if I only want to buy admission to the add-on class?</h2>

<p>If you are only interested in attending on Friday, and do not wish to
participate in the Saturday and Sunday courses, you may do so for an additional
$75 fee.</p>
-->

<h2>Can I purchase a ticket for only one day of the conference?</h2>

<p>Single-day passes are available for $75</p>

<h2>How can I contact you?</h2>

<p>You can contact the conference organizers by sending email to
<em>organizers</em> at <em>pghpw</em> dot <em>org</em>.</p>

<h2>Do I have to pick the track I want?</h2>

<p>No, you don't need to schedule your sessions.   On the day of the event, you
can go to whichever sessions you want.  Feel free to optimize your own schedule
by bouncing between tracks.</p>

<h2>What do I need to do to get the student discount?</h2>

<p>On the day of the event, you must bring a valid student ID card along
with photo identification.</p>

<h2>When will you announce the speakers and schedule of classes?</h2>

<p>The schedule will be announced a few weeks after the call for papers has
concluded.</p>

<h2>When will registration open?</h2>

[% IF global.config.payment_open %]

<p>Registration is now open!  Be sure to <a href="[% make_uri('purchase') %]">
purchase your event ticket today!</a></p>

[% ELSE %]

<p>Our goal is to provide a high-quality, low-cost experience for everybody.
This means we need to negotiate with our vendors and budget our costs before we
can set prices for the event.  Once we have done that, we will open
registration.  This usually happens two to three months prior to the event.</p>

<h2>What is this year's theme?</h2>

<p>In the past years, PPW has adopted a yearly theme.  However, we've found
that this hasn't added as much to the conference as we would have liked.</p>

<p>Instead, "the point of the conference" is to provide programmers and
students with great talks, focusing on pratical solutions in Perl to real
problems.</p>

<h2>Who profits from PPW?</h2>

<p>Perl Does!</p>

<p>The organizing team of PPW are a group of volunteers, who often end up
contributing out of their own pockets to make this event a success.   We want
to see everybody have a good time, learn new things, and then go home and do
great things with Perl.</p>

<p>It takes a great deal of money to host a Perl conference.   This event would
be impossible without ticket fees and generous support from our sponsors.  All
funds for PPW are held in stewardship by <a
href="http://perlfoundation.org">The Perl Foundation</a>, a 501(c)3
organization established for the benefit of the Perl programming language.  Any
excess funds at the end of PPW are held over to support the next PPW.   In the
event that PPW disolves, The Perl Foundation may use those funds for the other
great conferences that it supports.</p>

<h2>Why are you hosting this conference?</h2>

<p>Perl is a very powerful programming language.  While most commonly known for
its applications in systems administration and web site development, Perl is
useful for a lot more.   Perl is presently being used to power some very large
enterprise level applications.   This conference is our way of getting the word
out to people that didn't know how powerful it really is.</p>
