<h2>Who is this conference for?</h2> 

<p> Everybody! </p> 

<p> We will be running [% site.track_easy %] and [% site.track_hard %] tracks at the
event.   The [% site.track_easy %] track is perfect for programmers that have little or
no Perl experience.   Meanwhile, the [% site.track_hard %] track is suited for people
that have already been using Perl for a while.  </p>

<p>In [% site.event_year %], we bring back our well praised "<b>[% site.ztp_name %]
</b>" track.   This one-day special track, intended to
complement our introductory track, will be led by world-class trainer, Daniel
Klein, and will help bring you up to speed with Perl quickly.</p>

<h2>Is there an additional price for "[% site.ztp_name %]"?</h2>

<p>Yes, due to the additional costs associated with this course, there is an
additional fee.  Limited seating is available on a first-come first-serve
basis. </p>

<h2>If I attend [% site.ztp_name %], can I also go to other talks?</h2>

<p>[% site.ztp_name %] is a one-day course that runs concurrently with the workshop.
You will not be able to attend any talks on the same day that you are attending
the course, except for the keynote.</p>

<h2>Can I pay half-price for only one day of the conference?</h2>

<p>Sorry, due to the already very low costs of the event, it will not be
possible for us to make provisions for people that will only be attending for
one day.</p>

<h2>How can I contact you?</h2>

<p>You can contact the conference organizers by sending email to
<em>organizers</em> at <em>pghpw</em> dot <em>org</em>.</p>

<h2>Do I have to pick the track I want?</h2>

<p>No, you don't need to schedule your sessions.   On the day of the event, you
can go to whichever sessions you want.
Feel free to optimize your own schedule by bouncing between tracks.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, "[% site.ztp_name %]" is a
one-day course, and is designed to be attended from beginning to end.</p>

<h2>What do I need to do to get the student discount?</h2>

<p>On the day of the event, you must bring a valid student ID card along
with photo identification.</p>

<h2>When will you announce the speakers and schedule of classes?</h2>

<p>The schedule will be announced a few weeks after the call for papers has
concluded.</p>

<h2>When will registration open?</h2>

[% IF global.config.registration_open %]

<p>Registration is now open!  Be sure to <a href="[% make_uri('purchase') %]">
purchase your event ticket today!</a></p>

[% ELSE %]

<p>Our goal is to provide a high-quality, low-cost experience for everybody.
This means we need to negotiate with our vendors and budget our costs before we
can set prices for the event.  Once we have done that, we will open
registration.  This usually happens two to three months prior to the event.</p>

<h2>What is this year's theme?</h2>

<p>In the past years, PPW has adopted a yearly theme.  However, we've found
that this hasn't added as much to the conference as we would have liked.</p>

<p>Instead, "the point of the conference" is to provide programmers and
students with great talks, focusing on pratical solutions in Perl to real
problems.</p>

<h2>Who are the Pittsburgh Perl Mongers?</h2>

<p>We are a local branch of the Perl Mongers, a world-wide network of
programmers that like Perl.</p>

<h2>Why are you hosting this conference?</h2>

<p>Perl is a very powerful programming language.  While most commonly known for
its applications in systems administration and web site development, Perl is
useful for a lot more.   Perl is presently being used to power some very large
enterprise level applications.   This conference is our way of getting the word
out to people that didn't know how powerful it really is.</p>
