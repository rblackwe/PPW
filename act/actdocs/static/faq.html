<h2>Who is this conference for?</h2> 

<p> Everybody! </p> 

<p>Talk range from beginner to advanced, ensuring that there's something in
there for everybody.   Regardless if you are a programmer that has little or no
Perl experience, or have already been using Perl for quite some time, there
will be something for you.</p>

<p>In [% site.event_year %], we bring back our well praised "<b>[% site.ztp_name %]
</b>" track.   This one-day special track, intended to complement our
introductory talks, will help bring you up to speed with Perl quickly.</p>

<h2>Is there an additional price for the add-on classes?</h2>

<p>Yes, due to the additional costs associated with these courses, there is an
additional fee.  Limited seating is available on a first-come first-serve
basis. </p>

<h2>If I attend the add-on classes, can I also go to other talks?</h2>

<p>Yes.  For the first time ever, we will be holding the add-on classes on the
day before PPW.   This means that if you attend an add-on class, you will still
be able to attend PPW in its entirety.</p>

<h2>What if I only want to buy admission to the add-on class?</h2>

<p>If you are only interested in attending on Friday, and do not wish to
participate in the Saturday and Sunday courses, you may do so.</p>

<h2>Can I pay half-price for only one day of the conference?</h2>

<p>Sorry, due to the already very low costs of the event, it will not be
possible for us to make provisions for people that will only be attending for
one day.</p>

<h2>How can I contact you?</h2>

<p>You can contact the conference organizers by sending email to
<em>organizers</em> at <em>pghpw</em> dot <em>org</em>.</p>

<h2>Do I have to pick the track I want?</h2>

<p>No, you don't need to schedule your sessions.   On the day of the event, you
can go to whichever sessions you want.
Feel free to optimize your own schedule by bouncing between tracks.</p>

<h2>What do I need to do to get the student discount?</h2>

<p>On the day of the event, you must bring a valid student ID card along
with photo identification.</p>

<h2>When will you announce the speakers and schedule of classes?</h2>

<p>The schedule will be announced a few weeks after the call for papers has
concluded.</p>

<h2>When will registration open?</h2>

[% IF global.config.payment_open %]

<p>Registration is now open!  Be sure to <a href="[% make_uri('purchase') %]">
purchase your event ticket today!</a></p>

[% ELSE %]

<p>Our goal is to provide a high-quality, low-cost experience for everybody.
This means we need to negotiate with our vendors and budget our costs before we
can set prices for the event.  Once we have done that, we will open
registration.  This usually happens two to three months prior to the event.</p>

<h2>What is this year's theme?</h2>

<p>In the past years, PPW has adopted a yearly theme.  However, we've found
that this hasn't added as much to the conference as we would have liked.</p>

<p>Instead, "the point of the conference" is to provide programmers and
students with great talks, focusing on pratical solutions in Perl to real
problems.</p>

<h2>Who are the Pittsburgh Perl Mongers?</h2>

<p>We are a local branch of the Perl Mongers, a world-wide network of
programmers that like Perl.</p>

<h2>Why are you hosting this conference?</h2>

<p>Perl is a very powerful programming language.  While most commonly known for
its applications in systems administration and web site development, Perl is
useful for a lot more.   Perl is presently being used to power some very large
enterprise level applications.   This conference is our way of getting the word
out to people that didn't know how powerful it really is.</p>
