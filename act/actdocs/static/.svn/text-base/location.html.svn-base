  <a href="http://cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a> in Pittsburgh, PA.

    <p>
    There is free parking within walking distance of the university.  The
    closest parking lot to Wean Hall is the Morewood parking lot on Forbes
    Avenue (labeled P12 / "PPW Parking" on the map above).  Nearby hotels also
    operate shuttles to and from the university.
    </p>
    <p>
    From the Morewood parking lot, cross over Forbes Avenue.  Take the sidewalk
    down to the driveway right next to the short bridge overlooking Junction
    Hollow.  There is a bus stop at this driveway.
    </p>
    <p>
    Turn left into the driveway.  The CIC (Collaborative Innovation Center) will be
    on your right.
    </p>
    <p>
    Follow the driveway all the way....and turn left.  You will be standing in
    front on Newell-Simon Hall (can't miss it, the Gates/Hillman Complex is next
    door).
    </p>
    <p>
    Enter Newell-Simon Hall.  You will be on the 3rd floor.
    </p>
    <p>
    Go up the grand staircase to the 4th floor and head toward the glass bridge
    connecting Newell-Simon and Wean Halls.  The 4th floor of Newell-Simon
    connects to the 4th floor of Wean.
    <p>
    Go toward the library...and at the Library Decorative Light, turn right and
    you'll see the elevators.
    <p>
    Take the elevators up to the 7th floor.  The registration area is directly in
    front of the elevator.
