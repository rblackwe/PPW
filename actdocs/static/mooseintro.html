<h2>Intro to Moose</h2>

<p>There is an additional registration fee to take this course. Please be sure
to select the "[% site.moose_name %]" option when registering. Seating in this
course is limited to 15 students.</p>

<h2>About the course.</h2>

<p>Join us for an interactive hands-on course all about Moose. Moose is an OO system for Perl 5 that provides a simple declarative layer of "sugar" on top of a powerful, extensible meta-model.</p>

<p> With Moose, simple classes can be created without writing any subroutines, and complex classes can be simplified. Moose's features include a powerful attribute declaration system, type constraints and coercions, method modifiers ("before", "after", and "around"), a role system (like mixins on steroids), and more. Moose also has a vibrant ecosystem of extensions as seen in the variety of MooseX:: modules on CPAN.</p>

<p>This course will cover Moose's core features and explore some of the more powerful MooseX:: modules available on CPAN.</p>

<p>Students are expected to bring a laptop, as you will be writing code during the class. You will also be provided with a tarball a week or so before the class is scheduled, which will contain a directory tree skeleton and test files.</p>
